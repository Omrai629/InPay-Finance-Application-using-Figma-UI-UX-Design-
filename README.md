# InPay-Finance-Application-using-Figma-UI-UX-Design-
In this project , I have created a working prototype of a finance application called InPay using the software Figma. This application provides various services to its customers such as money transfer to another account , balance enquiry , sign-in/sign-up options , Profile updates etc

ABOUT FIGMA
Figma is a collaborative web application for interface design, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows. The feature set of Figma focuses on user interface and user experience design, with an emphasis on real-time collaboration.

Features:

1) Figma Runs Online:
                      Even though Figma is browser-based there are desktop version for both Windows and Mac OS. Presumably these are wrap applications which are running a browser inside them, but whether that’s the case or not, Figma is always running online within those apps. 
                      
2) Collaboration:
                   The “always online” nature of Figma actually provides some of the greatest strengths of the tool. One of those strengths is that Figma allows for live, real-time collaboration. You and your team members can all log into a design at once, simultaneously making changes to it.The fact that these designs are all saved online means that you never have to worry about any team members falling out of sync with the project. The latest changes are always right then in the file, and you needn’t worry about transferring files between team members, or pushing files to and from any third-party storage platform.
                      
3) Component Libraries:
                        Figma allows you to build up libraries of reusable components which the whole team has access to. Components give designers a head start on any existing design systems, and when a component is updated in the central library those changes are made across all designs for everyone.
                        
4) Prototyping and Code Output:
                                For prototyping you can create connections and hotspots on your design so you can simulate how a user would flow through that interface. For the coding phase Figma can generate SVG code, CSS, and iOS and Android code.

5) Auto Layout:
                If you’re going to learn Figma for UI design, you need to learn Auto Layout—it will make your life as a designer ten times easier! Adi Purdila will teach you how to use Auto Layout during this course, in just 30 minutes.
